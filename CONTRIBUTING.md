# Contributing

![Contributing to the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project](Media/Images/Student-Page-Banner.png)
We encourage students to submit their Unit Projects to this repository. Please follow the steps below to do so.

If you would like to volunteer to the research project or student program as a professional, please use the contact form and select **Professional Volunteer**.

# Bug Reports

If you would like to contribute bug fixes or make the team aware of bugs you have identified in the project, please raise a **Bug report** issue in the [Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classifiers repository issues](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-AI-Student-Program/issues/new/choose) section. A template is provided that will allow you to provide your suggestions for your bug report / bug fix(es) which will be reviewed by the team who will communicate through your issue.

# Creating a fork of the repository

![Creating a fork of the repository](Media/Images/Fork.png)
If you are going to submit your unit project, you will need to first make a fork of the current development branch. The current development branch will always be the highest branch or master.

Once you have created a fork of the repository, you should clone the repository to a location on your development machine using terminal and Git, or Github Desktop if using Windows. If you are using terminal and Git you can use the following code, to download on Github Desktop ensure that Github Desktop is open and select the option from the github repository root.

## Terminal & Git

Navigate to the directory you want to clone the project to and use the following command:

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/YourForkURL.git
```

# Set up your local directory

Now you have cloned the project, create your student directory locally. To do this navigate to your cloned copy of your fork, move into the UnitProjects directory and create a directory using your Github username, this will be your Unit Project space on the official Peter Moss Acute Myeloid / Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Student Program Github repository.

## Terminal & Git

From the project root, **AML-ALL-AI-Student-Program**, navigate to the **UnitProjects** directory and create your public directory using the your Github username and the following commands:

```
$ cd UnitProjects
$ mkdir YourGithubUsername
```

# Create your Unit Project directory.

Each Unit Project will have its own directory within your public directory. Ensuring you are in your local copy of **AML-ALL-AI-Student-Program/UnitProjects/YourGithubUsername**, use the following command to create your Unit Project Directory. Eg.**UnitProjects/YourGithubUsername/UnitTestID/ProjectID/**, replacing UnitTestID with your actual Unit Test ID and ProjectID with your Unit Test Project ID.

```
$ mkdir UnitTestID && cd UnitTestID && mkdir ProjectID
```

# Make local changes

![VS Code](Media/Images/VS-Code.png)

If you haven't decided on an IDE yet, we recommend **VS Code**, a free IDE by Microsoft. In VS Code you can open the project root, go to **File -> Open Folder** and navigate to your local **AML-ALL-AI-Student-Program** directory and select the **UnitProjects/YourGithubUsername** directory. From here you will be able to edit, create, import etc.

Regardless of IDE you would be using the directory structure of **AML-ALL-AI-Student-Program/UnitProjects/YourGithubUsername** where **UnitProjects/YourGithubUsername** is the root directory of your Unit Project directorie.

# Unit submission

![Unit submissions](Media/Images/Unit-Test-Submission.png)

The first step is to create your Unit Submission. This will provide information about your Unit Project(s) you are submitting.

&nbsp;

# Push changes to forked repository

![Push changes to forked repository](Media/Images/Contributing-Commit-Push.jpg)
When you have made your changes, you need to push them to your forked repository. This process requires a commit with a message about what your commit is, and then finally a push to the repository which will place your changes or created files to your forked repository.

&nbsp;

# Pull requests

When you are satisfied with your changes you can submit a pull request that will request that your changes be pulled into the latest development branch.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update all related README.md files with details of changes.
2. Add new README.md files for new directories, please include README branding.
3. Ensure that your READMEs documentation and code match the format/design of the rest of the repository.
